## Simple E-commerce Microservices System
### This is a simple simulation of an e-commerce system using microservices architecture with asynchronous communication via RabbitMQ. Includes services for Order Processing, Inventory Management, and Email Notifications, all communicating asynchronously to ensure efficient and decoupled operations.


### Technologies Used

- Node.js: Handles the core logic for each microservice.
- Express.js: Provides a lightweight framework for building RESTful APIs within each service.
- RabbitMQ: Manages asynchronous communication between services, ensuring efficient, event-driven interactions.
- Docker: Containerizes each service for consistent deployment and easy scalability.
